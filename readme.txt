This plugin allows you to showcase your business reviews collected through Arrivala on your WordPress website.

== Description ==

The Arrivala plugin integrates the reviews you've collected through your Arrivala account into your WordPress website.  The plugin allows you to do the following:
<ul>
<li>Add schema markup to your website to be read by search engines.  This can improve your search engine ranking.</li>
<li>Add Arrivala reviews to a floating widget allowing website visitors to view your most recent reviews.</li>
<li>Add a link to allow website visitors to review your business through Arrivala.</li>
</ul>

The plugin works right out of the box.  Once activated, enter your Arrivala account number (found in your Arrivala account) as well as a few details about your business and the plugin takes care of the rest.  The plugin fetches a JSON feed from Arrivala to display your most recent reviews to visitors and to search engines.
